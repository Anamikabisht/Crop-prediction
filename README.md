# ðŸŒ± Crop Recommendation System

This is a Machine Learning-based web application that recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and climatic conditions.  

The ML model is trained and saved as a `.pkl` file, which is integrated with a Flask backend. The frontend is designed using HTML and CSS.

## ðŸš€ Features
- User-friendly interface ðŸŒ¸
- Takes soil & weather inputs  
- Suggests the most suitable crop ðŸŒ¾  
- Built using Flask + Scikit-learn + HTML/CSS

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Accuracy Achieved:** 0.9931818181818182 (~99.31%)

### Why Random Forest?
- It is an **ensemble learning method** that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.  
- Handles both **classification and regression** problems effectively.  
- Reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree.  
- Works well with datasets containing both categorical and numerical features.  

### Model Training
- The model was trained using the dataset located in the `dataset/` folder.  
- Data preprocessing included handling missing values, feature scaling/encoding, and splitting into training/testing sets.  
- The Random Forest model was then trained on the processed data, and hyperparameters were tuned for optimal accuracy.  

### Performance
- Achieved high accuracy on the test dataset.  
- Evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
- The trained model is saved as a `.pkl` file for easy reuse.
